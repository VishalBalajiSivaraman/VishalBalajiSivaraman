### 👋 Hi there!

🎓 **Educational Background:**
- **Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
  _University of Florida_
- **M.S. in Electronics and Communication Engineering**  
  _University of Florida_
- **B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering**  
  _Rajalakshmi Engineering College_

🔍 **Research Interests:**
- 🤖 Transformers
- 🌀 Diffusion Models
- 📚 Large Language Models (LLMs)
- 🌐 Foundational Models

💡 **Professional Aspiration:**
- 🚀 Passionate about revolutionizing healthcare with cost-effective, cutting-edge AI solutions that deliver precision and efficacy.

🌟 **Highlighted Projects:**
- [RetinaRegNet](https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2404.16017) : RetinaRegNet revolutionizes retinal image registration by leveraging cutting-edge features from a latent diffusion model, capable of extracting retinal images of any modality without prior training on the dataset, making it one of the few models to implement a zero-shot learning approach in this field. The model effectively manages large deformations through a two-stage process, outperforming traditional methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across three challenging retinal image datasets. This project also served as my master's thesis. The code for this innovative project is provided below.
 
- [CIS-UNet: Aorta Multi-Class Segmentation via Shifted Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13049) : CIS-UNet is an advanced deep learning model designed for multi-class segmentation of the aorta and its branches in CT scans, enhancing the planning of minimally invasive aortic interventions. By integrating a novel Context-aware Shifted Window Self-Attention mechanism into a CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture, it significantly outperforms existing models, including the Swin-UNet proposed by Nvidia, in terms of segmentation accuracy and efficiency. Proven across extensive clinical datasets, CIS-UNet offers improved surgical planning and there are plans to release the dataset and code shortly.

💼 **Experience Highlights:**
-  Currently working as a full-time Research Assistant at the Medical Imaging Research for Translational Healthcare ([Mirth-AI](https://mirthai.medicine.ufl.edu/)) at my university, where I strive to develop cost-effective cutting-edge AI solutions for disease diagnosis and prognosis, thereby improving patient lives.

- Contributed to classified projects as an intern at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/), a leading defense technology company. Details of the work remain confidential.

### 👋 Hi there!
My name is Vishal Balaji Sivaraman. Yes, I know it's a bit long—I get that a lot! Feel free to call me Vishal or VBS, whichever you prefer. 😄

🎓 **Educational Background:**
- **Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
  _University of Florida_
- **M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
  _University of Florida_
- **B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering**  
  _Rajalakshmi Engineering College_

🔍 **Research Interests:**
- 🤖 Transformers
- 🌀 Diffusion Models
- 📚 Large Language Models (LLMs)
- 🌐 Foundational Models

🎯 **Goal:**
- 🌟 Aim to be a **P**owerhouse **O**f **K**nowledg**E** (**POKE**) star in the field of AI/ML.

💡 **Professional Aspiration:**
- 🚀 Passionate about revolutionizing healthcare with cost-effective, cutting-edge AI solutions that deliver precision and efficacy.

🌟 **Highlighted Projects:**
- [RetinaRegNet](https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2404.16017) : RetinaRegNet revolutionizes retinal image registration by leveraging cutting-edge features from a latent diffusion model, capable of handling retinal images of any modality without prior training. This positions it as one of the few models to implement a zero-shot learning approach in this innovative field. The model effectively manages large deformations through a two-stage process, surpassing traditional methods in registration accuracy and robustness across three challenging retinal image datasets. This project also served as my master's thesis, and the code for this novel project is provided below.
 
- [CIS-UNet: Aorta Multi-Class Segmentation via Shifted Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13049) :CIS-UNet is an advanced deep learning model designed for multi-class segmentation of the aorta and its branches in CT scans, enhancing the planning of minimally invasive aortic interventions. By integrating a novel Context-aware Shifted Window Self-Attention mechanism into a CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture, it significantly outperforms existing models, including [Nvidia's Swin-UNetr](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/novel-transformer-model-achieves-state-of-the-art-benchmarks-in-3d-medical-image-analysis/), in terms of segmentation accuracy and efficiency. Proven across an extensive cache of clinical patient CT scans, CIS-UNet offers improved surgical planning for endovascular treatments. The complete dataset and code will be released shortly. However, a small subset of the dataset has already been released for a grand challenge competition. Feel free to participate by clicking [here](https://aortaseg24.grand-challenge.org/).

💼 **Experience Highlights:**
-  Currently working as a full-time Research Assistant at the Medical Imaging Research for Translational Healthcare ([Mirth-AI](https://mirthai.medicine.ufl.edu/)) laboratory at the University of Florida. Here, I focus on developing cutting-edge deep learning and machine learning models for disease diagnosis and prognosis, with the aim of significantly enhancing patient care and treatment outcomes.

- Contributed to classified projects as an intern at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/), a leading defense technology company. Details of the work remain confidential.

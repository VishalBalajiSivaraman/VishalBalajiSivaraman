## 👋 Hi there!
My name is **Vishal Balaji Sivaraman**. Yes, I know it's a bit long—I get that a lot! Feel free to call me **Vishal** or **VBS**, whichever you prefer. 😄

### 🎓 Educational Background:
- **Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
  _University of Florida_
- **M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
  _University of Florida_
- **B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering**  
  _Rajalakshmi Engineering College_

### 🔍 Research Interests:
- 🖼️ **Autoencoders**
- 🤖 **Transformers**
- 🌀 **Diffusion Models**
- 🌐 **Foundation Models**
- 📚 **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- 🔁 **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

### 🎯 Goal:
- ✨ Aim to be a **P**owerhouse **O**f **K**nowledg**E** (**POKE**) star in the field of AI/ML.

### 💡 Professional Aspiration:
- 🚀 Passionate about revolutionizing healthcare with cost-effective, cutting-edge AI solutions that deliver precision and efficacy.

### 🌟 Highlighted Projects:
- [**RetinaRegNet**](https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2404.16017) (**Role**: **Principle Investigator**): RetinaRegNet revolutionizes retinal image registration by leveraging cutting-edge features from a CLIP guided-latent diffusion model, capable of registering retinal images of any modality without prior training. This positions it as one of the few models to implement a zero-shot learning approach in this innovative field. The model effectively manages large deformations through a multi-stage process, surpassing traditional methods in registration accuracy and robustness across three challenging retinal image datasets. This project also served as my master's thesis, and the code for this novel project is provided below.
 
- [**CIS-UNet: Aorta Multi-Class Segmentation via Shifted Self-Attention**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13049) (**Role**: **Project Contributor**): CIS-UNet is an innovative segmentation model combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Swin transformers for enhanced multi-class segmentation of the aorta and its branches in 3D Volumetric CT scans. The proposed model significantly outperforms conventional segmentation models, including [Nvidia's Swin-UNetr](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/novel-transformer-model-achieves-state-of-the-art-benchmarks-in-3d-medical-image-analysis/), by achieving high segmentation accuracy (dice coefficient) with optimal efficiency. Proven across an extensive cache of clinical patient CT scans, CIS-UNet can assist clinicians in real time by offering improved surgical planning for endovascular treatments. The complete dataset and code will be released shortly. However, a small subset of the dataset has already been released for a grand challenge competition.

### 💼 Experience Highlights:
- 👨‍🔬 Currently working as a full-time **Research Assistant** at the Medical Imaging Research for Translational Healthcare ([Mirth-AI](https://mirthai.medicine.ufl.edu/)) laboratory at the University of Florida. Here, I focus on developing cutting-edge deployable deep learning and machine learning applications for disease diagnosis and prognosis, with the aim of assisting clincians in real time whilst significantly enhancing patient care and treatment outcomes.

- 🛡️ Led the **Akida Initiative**, as an **Associate Systems Engineer intern** in **Mission Systems** at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/), a leading defense conglomerate, during the summer of 2023.

- 📚 Collaborated with researchers from [PALS](https://palspgm.com/), a prominent **IIT alumni hub**, as a **Product Developer Intern** to automate a series of complex lab experiments using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques into an eLearning platform, Virtual Labs ([Vlabs](https://palspgm.com/vlabs/)). This initiative by the **Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India**, under the **National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology**, played a pivotal role in steering engineering and science learning during the height of the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

- 🚢 Contributed to the **IoT Smart Boat** project proposed by **FOKA Tech**, an IoT startup under [ADR Group International](https://adrgrp.com/), in collaboration with [Rajalakshmi Engineering College](https://www.rajalakshmi.org). As a **Systems Engineer Intern**, I developed AI-based solutions to enhance maritime security by implementing a smart object and face tracking algorithm for real-time threat assessment using live surveillance feeds. Additionally, I designed a distinct context-aware control system to manage and monitor user-appliance interactions, optimizing battery power levels for large-scale boats docked on land and at sea.

- 👗 Collaborated with the Research and Development team at [Grroom](https://grroom.in/), a retail apparel and fashion company featuring the **India’s first AI-based styling application**, initiated by **IIT Bombay**. As a **Machine Learning Intern**, I focused on optimizing the performance and efficacy of their proprietary AI stylist platform to enhance user experience and provide personalized fashion recommendations tailored to client requirements.

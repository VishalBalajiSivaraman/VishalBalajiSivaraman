## 👋 Hi there!
My name is **Vishal Balaji Sivaraman**. Yes, I know it's a bit long—I get that a lot! Feel free to call me **Vishal** or **VBS**, whichever you prefer. 😄

### 🎓 Educational Background:
- **Ph.D. Student in Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
  _University of Florida_
- **M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering**  
  _University of Florida_
- **B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering**  
  _Rajalakshmi Engineering College_

### 🔍 Research Interests:
- 🖼️ **Autoencoders**
- 🤖 **Transformers**
- 🌀 **Diffusion Models**
- 🌐 **Foundation Models**
- 📚 **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- 🔁 **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**

### 🎯 Goal:
- ✨ Aim to be a **P**owerhouse **O**f **K**nowledg**E** (**POKE**) star in the field of AI/ML.

### 💡 Professional Aspiration:
- 🚀 Passionate about revolutionizing healthcare with cost-effective, cutting-edge AI solutions that deliver precision and efficacy.

### 🌟 Highlighted Projects:
- [**RetinaRegNet**](https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2404.16017) (**Role**: ***Principle Investigator***): RetinaRegNet revolutionizes retinal image registration by leveraging cutting-edge features from a CLIP guided-latent diffusion model, capable of registering retinal images of any modality without prior training. This positions it as one of the few models to implement a zero-shot learning approach in this innovative field. The model effectively manages large deformations through a multi-stage process, surpassing traditional methods in registration accuracy and robustness across three challenging retinal image datasets. This project also served as my master's thesis, and the code for this novel project is provided below.
 
- [**CIS-UNet: Aorta Multi-Class Segmentation via Shifted Self-Attention**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13049) (**Role**: ***Project Contributor***): CIS-UNet is an innovative segmentation model combining the strengths of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Swin transformers** for enhanced multi-class segmentation of the aorta and **24** distinct classes (i.e a combination of **14 branches** and **10 dissection zones**) in 3D Volumetric CT scans. The proposed model significantly outperforms conventional segmentation models, including [Nvidia's Swin-UNetr](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/novel-transformer-model-achieves-state-of-the-art-benchmarks-in-3d-medical-image-analysis/), by achieving high segmentation accuracy (dice coefficient) with optimal efficiency. My contributions to the project include **Data Curation & Annotation**, **Data Preprocessing**, **Preliminary Results**, and **Research Paper Writing**. Proven across an extensive cache of clinical patient CT scans, CIS-UNet can assist clinicians in real time by offering improved surgical planning for endovascular treatments. The complete dataset and code will be released shortly. However, a small subset of the dataset has already been released for a **Grand Challenge Competition**.

### 💼 Experience Highlights:
- 👨‍🔬 Currently working as a full-time **Research Assistant** at the Medical Imaging Research for Translational Healthcare ([Mirth-AI](https://mirthai.medicine.ufl.edu/)) laboratory at the University of Florida, where I focus on developing cutting-edge, deployable deep learning and machine learning models for medical imaging tasks, including Image Segmentation, Image Super-Resolution, and Image Registration, to assist clinicians by enhancing disease diagnosis and prognosis.

- 🛡️ Led the **Akida Initiative**, as an **Associate Systems Engineer intern** in **Mission Systems** at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/), a leading defense conglomerate, during the summer of 2023.

- 📚 Worked with researchers from [PALS](https://palspgm.com/), a prominent **IIT alumni hub**, as a **Product Developer Intern** to automate a series of complex lab experiments using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for an eLearning platform, Virtual Labs ([Vlabs](https://palspgm.com/vlabs/)) . This initiative, launched by the **Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India**, under the **National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology**, in collaboration with **PALS**, played a pivotal role in advancing engineering and science education during the height of the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

- 🚢 Contributed to the **IoT Smart Boat** project proposed by **FOKA Tech**, an IoT startup, in collaboration with [ADR Group International](https://adrgrp.com/). As a **Systems Engineer Intern**, I developed two innovative AI-based solutions to enhance maritime security by implementing a **Smart Face Recognition System**for real-time threat assessment using live surveillance feeds. Additionally, I designed a distinct **Context-Aware Control System** as part of the second project to manage and monitor user-appliance interactions, optimizing battery power levels for large-scale boats docked on land and at sea.

- 👗 Worked with the Research and Development team at [Grroom](https://grroom.in/), a retail apparel and fashion company featuring **India’s first AI-based styling application**, endorsed by **IIT Bombay**. As a **Machine Learning Intern**, I focused on optimizing the performance and effectiveness of their proprietary AI stylist platform to improve user experience and deliver personalized fashion recommendations tailored to client requirements.
